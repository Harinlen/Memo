/*!
 * \brief The KNLockedFile class is a supported class for the singleton
 * application. It modified from the QtLockedFile from the Clementine player.\n
 * This extends QFile with advisory locking functions.\n
 * A file may be locked in read or write mode. Multiple instances of
 * \e KNLockedFile, created in multiple processes running on the same machine,
 * may have a file locked in read mode. Exactly one instance may have it locked
 * in write mode. A read and a write lock cannot exist simultaneously on the
 * same file.\n
 * The file locks are advisory. This means that nothing prevents another process
 * from manipulating a locked file using QFile or file system functions offered
 * by the OS. Serialization is only guaranteed if all processes that access the
 * file use QLockedFile. Also, while holding a lock on a file, a process must
 * not open the same file again (through any API), or locks can be unexpectedly
 * lost.\n
 * The lock provided by an instance of \e KNLockedFile is released whenever the
 * program terminates. This is true even when the program crashes and no
 * destructors are called.
